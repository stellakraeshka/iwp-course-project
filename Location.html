        "On a geological time scale, this means that Old Tjikko has been around
        since the end of the last ice age, setting up shop as soon as the ice
        sheet disappeared." - Patrik Qvist

        "The area the tree first sprouted in almost 10,000 years ago was a harsh
        tundra region, but, as the climate began to warm, the tree was able to
        grow from a shrub to a normal tree formation." - Aimee Lamoureux

        "It seemed like a very good sign to begin with a pilot project together
        with such a celebrity as Old Tjikko, which seems so small and
        insignificant, most of it clinging to the ground. Clone or not, the age
        of 9950 year is simply amazing!" -Annette Arlander
