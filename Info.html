        <h1>Old Tjikko</h1>
        <p>
          is a 9,550 year-old Norway spruce, located on Fulufjället Mountain of
          Dalarna province in Sweden. Old Tjikko originally gained fame as the
          "world's oldest tree."Old Tjikko is, however, a clonal tree that has
          regenerated new trunks, branches and roots over millennia rather than
          an individual tree of great age. Old Tjikko is recognized as the
          oldest living Picea abies and the third oldest known clonal tree.
        </p>

        <p>
          The age of the tree was determined by carbon dating of genetically
          matched plant material collected from under the tree, as
          dendrochronology would cause damage. The trunk itself is estimated to
          be only a few hundred years old, but the plant has survived for much
          longer due to a process known as layering (when a branch comes in
          contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning
          (when the trunk dies but the root system is still alive, it may sprout
          a new trunk).
        </p>

        <p>
          The root system of Old Tjikko is estimated to be 9,562 years old,
          making it the world's oldest known Norway spruce. It stands 5 metres
          (16 ft) tall and is located on Fulufjället Mountain of Dalarna
          province in Sweden. For thousands of years, the tree appeared in a
          stunted shrub formation (also known as a krummholz formation) due to
          the harsh extremes of the environment in which it lives. During the
          warming of the 20th century, the tree sprouted into a normal tree
          formation. The man who discovered the tree, Leif Kullman (Professor of
          Physical Geography at Umeå University), attributed this growth spurt
          to global warming and gave the tree its nickname "Old Tjikko" after
          his late dog.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tree has survived for so long due to vegetative cloning. The
          visible tree is relatively young, but it is part of an older root
          system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may
          die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains
          intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for
          about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back
          in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's
          low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive
          to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering
          occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new
          roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast
          redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The
          tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system,
          which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years.
          Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the
          tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is
          supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the
          invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did
          not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of
          around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.
        </p>

        <p>
          The estimated age of Old Tjikko is close to the maximum possible for
          this area, as the last ice age's receding Fenno-Scandian ice sheet
          only released the Fulufjället Mountain around 10,000 years ago.Nature
          conservancy authorities considered putting a fence around the tree to
          protect it from possible vandals or trophy hunters.
